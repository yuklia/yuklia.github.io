(In our case it is Clickhouse DB)\nIt is not a secret that the most popular script in php frameworks is index.php but this information is barely helpful. So we need some “CPU statistics per route”.\n“CPU statistics per route” means that: we have to implement one more chart in Grafana that shows CPU consumption in the matter of requested route, for example, V2\\Community\\Model.php And only after that we can give this info to developers for investigation what kind of code took the most CPU in the route: V2\\Community\\Model.php When the developer got the list of routes it is time to look inside those routes and investigate what cause high CPU. On this stage Blackfire can help. Blackfire will show you CPU Wall Time. To keep things simple, Wall Time is usually split in two main parts: the CPU Time and the I/O Time.\nThe CPU time is the amount of time the CPU was used for processing instructions. The I/O time is the time the CPU waited for input/output (I/O) operations.\nI/O time could be divided into two parts: the network and the disk.\nNetwork activity includes calls to databases like:\nMySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB; HTTP calls to web services and APIs; Calls to cache systems like Redis and Memcached; Communications with services like queues, email daemons, remote filesystems; etc. Disk activity occurs when a program reads files from the filesystem, including loading code or files.\nWe need to distinguish these types of times in order to make further decisions related optimization.\nA CPU-bound program’s speed depends mostly on the CPU. In other words, CPU utilization is high for long periods of time. The faster the CPU, the faster the code runs. On the contrary, an I/O bound program’s speed is determined by the time spent waiting for I/O. Faster disks or a faster network improve the overall performance of I/O bound code.\n2 After that, depending on findings ⬇️ IF the reason of high CPU is I/O bound related to DB (too much time waiting for I/O ) then we should consider migrate to RDS and set up storage General Purpose (SSD) or Provisioned IOPS (SSD).\nIF the reason of high CPU : CPU-bound (which is rare case for web applications) then we should consider to optimize algorithms in code.\nto be continued… 👀\n","permalink":"https://yuklia.github.io/posts/php/high-cpu/","summary":"1 Add tools specifically to php monitoring in order to answer the questions ⬇️ what kind of php scripts were called most of the time? what kind of php scripts took the most CPU?

It’s assumed on the same host as Docker. xdebug.remote_connect_back = on checks $_SERVER[‘HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR’] and $_SERVER[‘REMOTE_ADDR’] variables to find out which IP address to use. You cannot use xdebug.remote_connect_back because it takes containers’s internal IP. So xdebug.remote_host is the only option we have. It’s pretty simple to get host IP on Linux OS just look at : ifconfig \u0026gt; docker0. Moreover you can create a fixed set of IPs for both host and containers using docker network. For instance:\ndocker network create -d bridge \\ — subnet 192.168.0.0/24 \\ — gateway 192.168.0.1 \\ dockernet Now each container can connect to the host under the fixed IP 192.168.0.1 But the docker0 interface is not available for Docker in macOS. This interface is actually within HyperKit. So unfortunately there is no a reliable way of looping back to host for macOS. The only solution is to create your local IP’s alias to something else : sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.254.254.254\nHowTo guide 👩‍💻 sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.254.254.254 (optional) For permanent setting up save.plist file sudo curl -o /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.yuklia.docker_localhost_alias.plist build docker containers \u0026hellip; add server to IDE storm1 configure Debug’s port in my case it’s 9002. xDebug client will knock to this port. storm2 configure DBGp Proxy storm3 Bonus 🍰 If you need to get a shell of the VM that was created by HyperKit run:\nscreen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty or screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty For getting all screens run: screen -ls For exiting screen run : screen -X -S %screen_name% kill Once you get the tty running you can navigate to /var/lib/docker: storm4 Here is my Dockerfile and docker-compose versions for php:7-fpm with XDebug So that’s all for now 😊.
